# IMAGE-CAPTION-EXTRACTION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
To develop an advanced image captioning system using deep learning techniques that can generate accurate, coherent, and contextually relevant textual descriptions for a wide range of images. Achieve high accuracy in generating captions that closely match human-provided descriptions.
Ensure the system can understand and describe not only the objects in the image but also their relationships and context.Implement attention mechanisms to improve focus on relevant image parts![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/018b6908-1062-4972-9925-6ebe930ed6a7)
